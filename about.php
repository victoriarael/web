    <h2>Welcome to Rael's World</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m <strong>Victoria Rael Atieno</strong>, a vibrant soul in her early 20s with a heart tuned to the rhythms of empathy, curiosity, and creativity. I'm passionate about mental wellness, intentional living, and using technology to make the world a little softer — and smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey into tech began not just with code, but with care. I believe the best solutions are the ones that listen first — to people, to pain points, to possibilities. Whether it’s building a therapist management system to support mental health professionals or helping digitize my family’s cereals business, I craft with compassion and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m someone who finds joy in the quiet: a well-written book, a soulful podcast, a playlist that understands your mood better than you do. I’m the kind of person who laughs loud, learns fast, and loves deeply. I enjoy coding, but I also enjoy human connection — which is why I strive to build websites that aren’t just functional, but feel human.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll often find me sketching out ideas, journaling thoughts, or deep-diving into YouTube documentaries at 2 a.m. I’m part thinker, part doer, and full-time dreamer — with one foot in tech and the other in the stories that make us human.
