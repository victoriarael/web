    <h2>Building with Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      I am deeply passionate about starting meaningful projects and seeing them through to completion. There’s something incredibly satisfying about building something from scratch, watching it grow, and knowing it makes a difference — no matter how small. Whether it's for learning, helping others, or supporting a business, I enjoy every step of the process, from the idea stage to the final execution.

    <p>Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Therapist Management System:</strong> A digital platform to help therapists manage clients, appointments, and therapy records in an organized and secure way.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Web Application for Cereals Business:</strong> A website to showcase and manage my family's cereals business — including product listings, customer orders, and contact information.</li>

      <li><strong>Java-Based Projects:</strong> I’m exploring object-oriented programming and building small Java programs to strengthen my backend development skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each of these projects is helping me grow both technically and personally. I look forward to expanding my portfolio and applying these skills in the real world.

    <h2>Why These Projects?</h2>
    <p>They reflect my journey as a learner, developer, and innovator. Each project solves a real need — from improving mental health services to supporting my family's business.</p>
    <p>I aim to keep learning and using technology to create impact, one solution at a time.</p>
