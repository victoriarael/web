      <h2>Code That Cares</h2>
      <p>
        I believe technology can be kind. My projects are more than just practice — they’re built with heart. Whether it’s simplifying life for others or supporting growth through books, I want every page, feature, and function to mean something.
      </p>

      <!-- Bookstore project -->
      <h3>Online Bookstore for Growth</h3>
      <p>
        This is not just a bookstore — it's a curated space filled with books that nourish the mind and soul. Built with HTML and CSS, this project blends functionality with purpose. It showcases titles that promote personal development, mental wellness, emotional intelligence, and self-discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly — with room to grow into a full e-commerce system. It's my way of using tech to share what has helped me become more grounded, hopeful, and inspired.
      </p>

      <!-- Other projects -->
      <h3>Web App for Cereals Business</h3>
      <p>
        A custom site designed to support my family's cereals shop. It includes product displays, order tracking, and a contact feature — helping modernize a traditional business.
      </p>

      <h3>Java-Based Learning Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Through Java, I’ve been strengthening my backend skills with simple, real-world logic like student records, login systems, and billing modules. These projects sharpen my thinking and problem-solving mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of these projects represents a step forward — technically, emotionally, and purposefully.

      <h2>Why I Code</h2>
      <p>I don’t just code for grades or practice — I code to express, to build meaning, to serve people. Whether it's a business, a book, or a better workflow — I want it to feel human.</p>
      <p>Every click and scroll in my projects should feel like care.</p>
