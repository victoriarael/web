      <p>
        I really treasure my personal time — those quiet moments to relax, reflect, and just unwind from the busyness of life.
        To make the most out of this precious time, I always try to accompany it with something that brings me joy, peace, or inspiration.
      </p>

      <p>Here are some of the things I enjoy doing in my free time:</p>

      <!-- List of personal hobbies -->
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> I love getting lost in a good book — whether it's a novel, self-help, or something educational. Reading helps me escape, learn, and grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Listening to Music:</strong> Music is my therapy. I enjoy different genres depending on my mood.</li>
        <li><strong>Nature Walks:</strong> Being in green spaces clears my mind and brings peace.</li>
        <li><strong>Watching Inspiring Content:</strong> Documentaries and podcasts are my go-to!</li>
        <li><strong>Coding for Fun:</strong> Exploring small creative coding challenges is relaxing and fun.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My hobbies help me recharge and stay connected to myself, which I believe is essential for personal growth and happiness.

      <h2>Why Hobbies Matter</h2>
      <p>
        These hobbies are more than just activities — they’re part of how I take care of my mental health and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we do with our free time shapes how we show up in everything else — especially in tech and life.
